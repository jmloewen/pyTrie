This is a Python3 implementation of a Trie, using Dictionaries.


## Features:
* insert a dictionary into TrieNode.
* insert words & payloads to TrieNode.
* remove words from TrieNode.
* export TrieNode as dictionary.
* return value in Trie given key.

## Future Feature Goals:
* Full test suite.
* Print entire Trie, given a child node.
* Faster export function (current implementation is slow).
* Include ability to parse through dicts nested in arrays, arrays nested in arrays.
* Include Array as alternative to dictionary.
  * Include ability to export as an array.
* Potential Goals:
  * Allowance for duplicate values within a single key.
  * Case sensitivity in letters.

## End Goal:
* Compliance with JSON standard 
  * should be able to import JSON dictionary, add values to it, and export as a new JSON dictionary.
